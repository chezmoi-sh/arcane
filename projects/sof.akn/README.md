## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

Spirit of Fire[^1] is a personal self-hosted platform for home services, designed to provide a complete ecosystem for media management, life organization, and automation. The platform runs on a Kubernetes cluster and is accessible through both local network and VPN, allowing secure access to services from anywhere while maintaining control over data and infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture diagram](./assets/architecture.svg)

### üèóÔ∏è Platform Infrastructure

* **[Cilium](https://cilium.io/)**: Container Network Interface (CNI). <br/>
  Advanced networking, security policies, and observability for Kubernetes clusters.

* **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)**: Mesh VPN network. <br/>
  Zero-config VPN mesh for secure remote access to the entire platform.

* **[External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/)**: Secrets management operator. <br/>
  Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems.

* **[External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns)**: DNS automation. <br/>
  Automatically configures DNS records for Kubernetes services.

* **[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)**: Certificate automation. <br/>
  Automatic provisioning and management of TLS certificates in Kubernetes.

* **[kgateway](https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway)**: Cloud-native API Gateway. <br/>
  Envoy-based gateway with Kubernetes Gateway API support, optimized for service routing.

* **[Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/)**: Distributed block storage. <br/>
  Lightweight, reliable, and powerful distributed block storage system for Kubernetes.

* **[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnativepg.io/)**: PostgreSQL operator. <br/>
  Comprehensive platform designed to seamlessly manage PostgreSQL databases within Kubernetes environments.

### üì∫ Media Services

* **[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)**: Media server. <br/>
  Volunteer-built media solution that puts you in control of your media.

* **[Jellyseerr](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)**: Media requests. <br/>
  Free and open source software application for managing requests for media libraries.

### üè† Life Management

* **[Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.com/)**: Budget management. <br/>
  Personal finance app that helps you track your spending and save money.

* **[Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/)**: Document management. <br/>
  Document management system to store, search and share documents.

### üì¶ Others

* **[Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding)**: Bookmarking service. <br/>
  Self-hosted bookmarking and link aggregation service.

* **[Atuin](https://docs.atuin.sh/)**: Shell history sync. <br/>
  Encrypted shell history sync, storing all your shell commands in one place.

* **[TaskChampion](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskchampion-sync-server)**: Task management sync. <br/>
  Sync server for TaskWarrior, a modern task management system.

## üöÄ How to use / How to develop on it

This project uses [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) for GitOps-based deployment and [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for configuration management. Here's how to work with it:

## üíÄ Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

The recovery process is largely automated through the `amiya.akn` project, which hosts ArgoCD and automatically bootstraps any Kubernetes clusters it detects in the Tailscale mesh.

### Automated Recovery Process

> \[!NOTE]
> If the system cannot be managed using Talosctl, reboot on a live CD

1. **Reset/Reinstall Talos OS**:
   ```bash
   # If the system is still accessible
   talosctl reset --nodes $TALOS_NODE_IP --endpoints $TALOS_NODE_IP --graceful=false --reboot

   # Otherwise, reinstall from ISO/PXE and bootstrap the cluster
   talosctl bootstrap --nodes $TALOS_NODE_IP --endpoints $TALOS_NODE_IP
   ```

2. **Install Tailscale Operator** - the only manual step required:
   ```bash
   # Install via Helm
   helm repo add tailscale https://pkgs.tailscale.com/helmcharts
   helm upgrade --install tailscale-operator tailscale/tailscale-operator \
     --namespace=tailscale --create-namespace \
     --set-string oauth.clientId="<OAuth client ID>" \
     --set-string oauth.clientSecret="<OAuth client secret>" \
     --wait
   ```

3. **Automatic Detection** - Once the cluster joins the Tailscale mesh, `amiya.akn` detects it automatically

4. **Auto-Bootstrap** - ArgoCD deploys all applications and configurations via GitOps

### Manual Verification

* Check cluster status: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
* Verify Tailscale connectivity: `tailscale status`
* Confirm ArgoCD sync status in the `amiya.akn` console

> The entire platform is designed for zero-touch recovery once Tailscale is configured.
