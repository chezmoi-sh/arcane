# Adopt Centralized Secret Management Solution

## Context and Problem Statement

### Current Architecture Overview

The current secret management for the Arcane infrastructure project (specifically the `amiya.akn` cluster) relies on a distributed Git repository approach with secrets encrypted using [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops). The architecture operates as follows:

1. **Secret Storage**: Secrets are stored in a Git repository, encrypted using SOPS with GPG keys
2. **Synchronization**: An ArgoCD application synchronizes these encrypted secrets into the cluster
3. **Distribution**: The [ExternalSecret Operator](https://external-secrets.io/) retrieves secrets and makes them available to applications
4. **Network Dependency**: The entire workflow depends on Tailscale's network proxy for the ExternalSecret Operator to access the Kubernetes API of the "source" cluster

### Critical Problems Identified

This architecture, while functional, presents **two major critical problems**:

#### 1. Critical Dependency on Tailscale Network Proxy

* **Single Point of Failure**: The entire secret synchronization workflow depends on Tailscale's network proxy
* **Internet Outage Impact**: Any internet or Tailscale service outage completely halts secret synchronization
* **Deployment Blocking**: Outages impact new deployments and application stability
* **Recovery Complexity**: Manual intervention required during network issues

#### 2. Operational Complexity and Cognitive Load

* **Multi-System Management**: Secrets require interaction with multiple, loosely coupled systems:
  * Git for storage and versioning
  * GPG/SOPS for encryption and decryption
  * Tailscale for network access control
  * Kubernetes API for secret distribution
* **Difficult Auditing**: No centralized audit trail across the distributed systems
* **Knowledge Barriers**: Requires deep understanding of multiple technologies
* **Error-Prone Workflows**: Manual processes increase risk of misconfigurations

### Impact on Operations

These limitations directly impact:

* **Reliability**: Service outages due to network dependency
* **Developer Experience**: Complex workflows for routine secret operations
* **Compliance**: Difficulty meeting audit and governance requirements
* **Scalability**: Challenges adding new applications and teams

### Strategic Question

How do we implement a modern, centralized secret management solution that eliminates single points of failure, provides enterprise-grade security controls, and offers better operational capabilities while maintaining self-hosting principles and integration with existing infrastructure (Authelia SSO, Kubernetes, ArgoCD)?

## Decision Drivers

* **Reliability**: Eliminate critical dependency on Tailscale network proxy
* **Security**: Implement fine-grained access controls and comprehensive audit trails
* **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce complexity of multi-system secret management
* **User Experience**: Provide modern web interface for secret operations
* **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Kubernetes/ArgoCD infrastructure
* **Self-Hosting**: Maintain control over secret management infrastructure
* **SSO/OIDC**: Integration with existing Authelia for centralized authentication

## Considered Options

* **Infisical** - Modern open-source secret management platform
* **HashiCorp Vault** - Industry standard secret management solution
* **AWS Secrets Manager** - Managed cloud service
* **Continue with SOPS** - Maintain current Git-based approach

## Decision Outcome

**Decision Evolution (MADR Pattern):**

### Initial Decision (2025-01-20): Infisical

Chosen option: "Infisical", because it provided modern UI, self-hosting capabilities, and appeared to have OIDC support in the open-source version.

**Implementation Progress:**

* ‚úÖ Phase 1 completed: Infrastructure deployment with PostgreSQL, Redis, NetworkPolicy
* ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation and disaster recovery procedures
* ‚úÖ Backup/restore testing scripts

### Revised Decision (2025-01-23): HashiCorp Vault

**SUPERSEDED**: During implementation, discovered that **OIDC SSO is an Enterprise-only feature** in Infisical, which fundamentally breaks the integration architecture with Authelia.

**New chosen option**: "HashiCorp Vault", because:

* OIDC/SSO is available in the open-source version
* Industry standard with extensive ecosystem support
* Better long-term viability and community support
* More robust secret management capabilities
* Proven integration with Kubernetes and ExternalSecret Operator

### Revised Decision (2025-01-24): OpenBao

**SUPERSEDED**: During implementation, discovered that **PKCS#11 auto-unseal is an Enterprise-only feature** in HashiCorp Vault. This is a critical capability for the desired security posture, as it avoids storing unseal keys directly in the Kubernetes cluster.

**New chosen option**: "OpenBao", because:

* It is a community-driven, open-source fork of HashiCorp Vault.
* It includes key enterprise features from Vault, such as **PKCS#11 auto-unseal**, in its open-source version.
* It maintains API compatibility with Vault, allowing for a seamless transition and use of the existing ecosystem (like the ExternalSecret Operator).
* It aligns perfectly with the project's self-hosting and security-first principles without incurring licensing costs for essential features.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

* ‚úÖ **Successful implementation completed** (2025-06-28)
* ‚úÖ **OIDC integration with Authelia** for centralized authentication (pending configuration)
* ‚úÖ **Industry-standard solution** with extensive documentation and community
* ‚úÖ **Proven scalability** and enterprise-grade features in open source
* ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL backend** with CloudNativePG for robust data persistence and backup
* ‚úÖ **Auto-unseal capabilities** (via PKCS#11/SoftHSM) for better operational security
* ‚úÖ **Complete ExternalSecret Operator integration** for seamless secret distribution

**Negative:**

* Learning curve steeper than Infisical's user-friendly interface
* More complex initial configuration and maintenance
* Infrastructure restart required (previous Infisical and Vault work needs to be replaced)
* Additional time investment due to another technology change

### Implementation Status

**Completed Components:**

* ‚úÖ **OpenBao deployment** with Helm chart and custom SoftHSM-enabled image
* ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL backend** using CloudNativePG with automated backups to S3
* ‚úÖ **Auto-unseal configuration** via PKCS#11/SoftHSM tokens
* ‚úÖ **ExternalSecret Operator integration** with proper RBAC and SecretStore
* ‚úÖ **Network configuration** with Tailscale ingress and HTTPRoute for external access
* ‚úÖ **Backup and disaster recovery** procedures with S3-based CNPG backups

**Pending Configuration:**

* üîÑ **OIDC authentication integration** with Authelia (infrastructure ready)
* üîÑ **Security audit** of NetworkPolicy and RBAC configurations
* üîÑ **Secrets migration** from SOPS to OpenBao
* üîÑ **Pilot application integration** testing

**Note**: This ADR documents the evolution of the decision-making process. While the initial implementation with Infisical was successful from a technical standpoint, the discovery of licensing limitations for critical features necessitated a strategic pivot. A similar issue with HashiCorp Vault's enterprise licensing for PKCS#11 auto-unseal has led to the adoption of OpenBao to ensure the architecture meets all security and operational requirements without compromise. This evolution demonstrates the value of documenting architectural decisions and being prepared to adapt when new information emerges.
