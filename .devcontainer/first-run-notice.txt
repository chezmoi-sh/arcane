👋 Welcome to the Atlas Dev Container / Codespace!
This space contains everything required to use, build, update and edit
the Atlas infrastructure (aka. my homelab).

📚 No documentation has been written yet ... but it is planned
🐳 Registry UI is available on http://oci.local.chezmoi.sh:5000/
🚀 How to build or update the infrastructure ?
   - `yarn`
   - `pulumi login`
   - `cd <project> && pulumi up`
